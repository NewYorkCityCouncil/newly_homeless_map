# newly_homeless_map

This file supplements the New York City Council's analysis of homelessness. 

Open Data sources, cited and reproduced in the code, have been used to create a map of last known community boards from which
shelter entrants come. This information has been used to create an average for the last rolling year of data.  Accordingly,
rerunning this code, you may find your results differ from ours, as the code is designed to use the most recent 12 months of
data available.
